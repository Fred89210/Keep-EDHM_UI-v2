# Keep EDHM_UI v2

If you want to keep [EDHM_UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI) v2 while waiting for [EDHM_UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI) v3 to become more stable, but you still want to use the latest version of [EDHM](https://github.com/psychicEgg/EDHM/tree/main/Odyssey), this script is for you.

This script automatically replaces certain files in [EDHM_UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI) v2 so that it installs and runs with the latest version of EDHM.

---

- **Close the game**.
- Install [EDHM_UI v2.2.67](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases/tag/v2.2.67) if it hasn't already
- Run the [latest version of the script](https://github.com/Fred89210/Keep-EDHM_UI-v2/releases)
If all goes as expected, the script will start [EDHM_UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI) when it finishes, and [EDHM_UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI) will install the new version of [EDHM](https://github.com/psychicEgg/EDHM/tree/main/Odyssey).

This script has been designed and tested only on Windows 10/11.
